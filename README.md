# Game-of-CHOMP
Chomp is a two-player game played on a rectangular grid. In my version it is played against the computer. 
The two players take turns picking squares, and once they do,they remove (or eat) every square of the chocolate bar that is on bottom of the
one they picked or to its right. The player who eats the poisoned square loses.
